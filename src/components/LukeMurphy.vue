<p class="interviewbody">I wanted to talk to you because I remember that you’ve made some changes regarding how you browse the Internet or use your phone on a daily basis. I’m thinking of different search engines, messaging apps, etc that are known to be “less evil or “severe” with data gathering and tracking capabilities.Can you tell me about some of those changes you’ve made and differences between them and say Gmail, google whatsapp etc, and when you felt you needed to make them and why? Has an awareness of surveillance and privacy changed the way you operate in your professional work as well?

<p class="interviewbody">Yes, you're right, I have been experimenting a lot with what technology feels right since about 2013 when all that Snowden stuff hit the news. I guess some of my weirder experiments kind of "leaked out" into conversations with friends at some point...you got me! I can't really blame people actually, trying to use privacy respecting technologies  gets a bad doing over in the news...</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Yeah, the entire reason for starting to try and use more surveillance resistance technologies was because of what is commonly called the Snowden revelations. The exceptionally gnarly leaks that brought out the NSA surveillance programs.</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I was using Gmail as my mail provider, so I started to look into another email provider. Google was still considered quite a nice company back then but I see things are changing (Fuck Of Google campaign). Anyway, it was enough for me to make the jump at that time. Back then, that was pretty scary for me even though I work in software. I didn't know if I could trust this other provider and of course, the bar had risen. Do they encrypt my mail at rest? Do they have 2-factor authentication? Do they have a warrant canary? Are the VC funded?  And more! I wasn't asking all those questions to begin with but they pop up now when I have to make a choice on technology.</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I'm not sure why I felt like I had to make the switch but I guess it has something to do with how much passion I have for technology. It gives me a lot of joy. And the abuse was really just sucking it out. I guess that really hit a nerve at the time. I think I may have also wanted to help people learn more since they would invariably ask me but I quickly realised that most people would not switch until years later. For example, my father finally, in the year of our lord, 2020, switched over from Gmail.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">This definitely changed how I felt at work. Surveillance was a massive societal issue and nobody gave a fuck at most jobs. I left a few jobs out of disgust. There weren't any unions where I was. I guess this ultimately led me to work in technology cooperatives later on. That also has something to do with how a lot of start-ups work but that story is for another time maybe ;)

<p class="interviewbody">Sometimes it feels like there is a large denial factor or indifference when I talk to others about this (I find that within myself sometimes) that comes when facing up to such a massive system as many of these things aren’t visible and difficult to comprehend for many. Or many just say I have nothing to hide, I don’t really care, etc. How do you find the media portrays people or organizations that try and use privacy respecting technologies?
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Its interesting that you admit that it was scary for you as someone who has more knowledge than most of this topic, you still needed those services – to function in society hah, but you were willing to do the work to find other providers and like you said if you changed, then maybe you could encourage the people around you to change, like your Dad and “cough.. maybe me who has Gmail cough”.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">This may be an ignorant question but wasn’t it an enormous amount of work to do this?
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I’m am also very curious about what you learnt about the structure of start ups and their link to surveillance software issues. If you’re comfortable could you shed some light on your experiences there? I mean they are kind of the foundational models that give birth to of all these surveillance apps, like Nest home, etc.

<p class="interviewbody">Around 2013 and a year or two after, this was a big topic of debate in my circles but I haven't had to speak to the topic for a while.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Uhhhmmm, so the media situation, yeah, it is complicated. I see a lot of day-to-day crime  reports boil down to "these people are criminals and they used encryption to communicate and that is bad!" I read a story like this just today. It also credited, and I quote, "permanent surveillance" (CCTV) as an aid in catching them. Permanent!
</p>


<p class="interviewbody">However, there are counter-narratives from, say, here in the Netherlands, Bits of Freedom, which promote encryption as requirement for privacy and they get a lot of good coverage. I guess it is wider than the news itself, I mean, wasn't the Australian government pushing a bill to ban encryption recently? And the UK government dropped that Snoopers charter? Governments also drive suspicion and division on this topic.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody"> The why of this is historical, as far I understand. It's all tied up in that declaration of the independence of cyberspace, cyberpunk, wikileaks, crypto-anarchist, hacker, libertarian, blah blah thing. I guess encryption is just a problem when you want to know what people are saying. But of course, there are ways around it and those are subtle. Metadata and the like.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody"> For the effort, I guess it was enormous :) Most people just thought I was a kook. Which I guess I am, tin foil hats and so on. (I do have one, as you've seen). It was only later on when it become more of a social issue and not a technical thing, that a lot more critics and activists produced arguments and reasoning that was easier to pick up and have a more accessible conversation. Trust is still an issue and always will be. I do like that more and more friends do come to me recently and ask about companies behind technology. It is getting a little harder to just pick up any software and use it withoutthinking about who made it and for what purpose!
</p>

<p class="interviewbody"> As for the start-ups, I think I can lay it out pretty easily now. This way of running a business was sold to me in college as totally subversive and revolutionary. It took years to figure out that it was a lie but I guess they got the best out of me by then! Usually, the technology is mostly completely separated from any political issues and wrapped up as "an interesting problem to solve". The last start-up I worked in was writing software for the operation and maintenance of public bicycle fleets but as soon as that was figured out as not profitable, the "pivot" came and were suddenly focused on private fleets. Google was the next customer! No workers had any say in that and we didn't have any organisation to make a collective complaint. I didn't understand that was an option at that time.

  <p class="interviewbody"> What about technology brings you so much joy, and with what you know now, are you optimistic? I mean you are still working in it haha. Have your views changed?
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> I think this kind of start up mentality is what is propelling the covid track and trace application boom, the idea that technology in a vacum can fight corona, given your experience in software and mentioned above decisions, when governments say that the information will be private, will be deleted afterwords etc, what goes through your head? Any alarm bells or questions you would ask? And do you know of any way (software wise) that this could actually be possible, create a system that would actually protect the users privacy?

  <p class="interviewbody"> Yeah great question on optimism. Again, thinking about my Dad, he recently discovered that there actually are alternatives to the surveillance capitalists and once he got a new mail provider, he was basically reborn in his conviction that technology can be good and fun again. I guess he knew but he didn't have the headspace to get into it. And for years, almost 7 years later then me, I think he was really bummed out until then about technology.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> I guess I was also. I've been playing with computers since I was 14 or something, so I guess my relationship with them is too long to fit in here. Writing computer programs that are useful to other people is still fun. And there are a lot of exciting projects underway which provide ways to experiment with other network topologies and social organising which, do actually bring the command-and-control way of operating into
question. I'm thinking of the many layers of the Fediverse and peer-to-peer technologies such as the Hypercore protocol lately. We have a lot more options now that we didn't have before. One major recent advance is that people are putting regular GNU/Linux distributions on phones now, so you don't have to just settle for Googles Android. That's a big advance for user freedom.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> Yeah, for me, the Covid apps were just something I couldn't really get into. It was ridiculous proposal for me that software could be used to help. How the Dutch government handled it was ridiculous. We don't need phone apps we need tests. Software could help but the way it was proposed as the main strategy for the solution and with all the known technical challenges, was and is astounding. However I know there are some good proposals for decentralised alternatives as proposed by some people from the CCC.
