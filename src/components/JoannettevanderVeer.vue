<p class="interviewbody">Lately I've been thinking about a possible dual nature of surveillance.
On one hand with the development and soon release of a corona-virus track and trace application, that is being marketed as a (positive) technique to control the spread of virus.
Then with the protests around the world for the Black Lives Matter movent, police and government tracking surveillance measures are heavily being deployed against protestors in public spaces. I’m very curious to know your opinion on all this, as I find (could be projecting here) that a lot of your work has an activist quality to it and both the corona virus and protests, are concentrated on trying to control movements of individuals through public space.

<p class="interviewbody">I definitely try to question all forms of control, whether it's the government, the police, the institutions or the architectural associations. I think we have this underlying misconception that without "control", there's chaos. I inherently disagree with this.</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I like to think of the systems that we need as "scaffolding" as opposed to a "permanent structure" or "superstructure" I've been thinking about this analogy on various forms of my practice.  And I think it applies here. To me surveillance can be effective if it's more flexible, much like scaffolding is.... and it becomes a problem when it is seen as a superstructure which is necessary to hold everything together.</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I don't think that surveillance is that important, it plays a role, but not as much as we think it does. How many times have houses or stores been robbed when there are cameras everywhere, or alarms, or security guards or police officers around? These forms of surveill-ing the public doesn't work and especially not in the public realm.</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I think the underlying issues here are socio-economic, and putting money into the community as opposed to putting money into surveillance.

<p class="interviewbody">This idea that you raise of the belief that without control there is chaos, it made me think perhaps we have this fear of the unknown, like we’ve been taught through media through government etc, that the decision making or power is out of our hands, that we are not capable and so everything has to be controlled
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I love this concept of scaffolding. Can you elaborate on what you mean? If we think of surveillance as scaffolding, can it be built up or taken down, added, subtracted etc, by anyone?
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I recently read about an app in Taiwan that provides information on masks and where to get them, so you don’t have to que in long lineups. The government released the initial version but the hacker community started to collaborate with the government and updated the app to be more accessible to the visually impaired, etc.  Could this example be in line with the scaffolding concept? Open participatory frameworks rather than closed?
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I agree completely with your last point, but I think whats happening is a collusion of interests here, the surveillance companies need crime (in a sense) to prove that their product works, and so it becomes a feedback loop.
</p>

  <p class="metadata">On June 17th 2020 at 7:31 pm Reza wrote </p>

<p class="interviewbody">Yes, the fear of the unknown is something, which we've been brainwashed with throughout our lives, through media, films, music and our cultures/traditions.  Funny I was just speaking of this with my parents, the culture of fear which we see has been gaining momentum for the past decade, is dividing people to a degree which is so difficult to watch.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I also see this fear not just towards people, which results in prejudice or racism, but also fear of pursuing things we want to pursue.  Fear holds people back so much, that many are willing to live unhappily in defense of fear instead of facing it and living a more fruitful life.
</p>


<p class="interviewbody">And in terms of scaffolding - it's funny I've been using this term since last year, the first time I wrote about it was in this blog post almost exactly a year ago  https://www.instagram.com/p/BzRqQAvJJrz/. I see the concept of scaffolding as a universal term, which could be applied to many facets of our society.  I generally like to question anything that is "absolute" except maybe math or science (in some cases) but anything in the social sciences and humanities cannot be absolute, things need to be constantly questioned and scrutinized. So the idea of surveillance being a "good" think which will "avoid" crime or the spread of the virus I tend to question. I think we need to think deeper in understanding the roots of the problems.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody"> The Taiwan example is super interesting and I definitely think that the collective participatory actions are more meaningful and effective and the loosely structured systems need to account for these sorts of actions.  To use an architectural example, it's like Alejandro Aravena's "half house" idea sort of.... that the structure is set up loosely, in order to support individual growth.
</p>

    <p class="metadata">On June 17, 2020 at 7:50 pm- Gill wrote </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> Fear of something can prevent us from action, but once you somehow move through the fear (which is uncomfortable as hell) you usually come out the other side a bit dazed and confused but still alive for the most part. Fear can also be motivating in a way.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> Right so in this example of Aravena's “half-house” our scaffolding is a way to set up the primary living conditions, but then you hand over the agency or the decision making to the agent and let that play out how the agent deems best. The question I'm wondering is what is the scaffolding in terms of our concept of surveillance? and could that be useful...
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> I'm wondering as an architect, have you ever considered how people are going to be surveilled as they move through the spaces you designed? Do you think anyone who designs buildings or public spaces (especially public spaces) considers this? I know when I was working in architecture I didn't consider surveillance at all. I remember I once spent a full 8-hour day placing cameras on shop drawings for a project as advised by a security company.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> I agree about fear being motivating too but I think it depends on your willingness to dive into the unknown, which on its own requires some fearlessness. All that to say... I think encouragement and context really define how willing someone is in terms of using fear as a motivator as opposed to something, which paralyzes.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> I think the concept of scaffolding here in terms of surveillance is more about the community.  Empowering members of the community and the community organizations to promote and encourage values, which benefit the community at large.  Instead of surveilling or policing which instills more fear into people.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> As an architect, I think the first time I thought about surveillance or the idea of being watched/surveilled was when I was doing my thesis. A part of my project was designing a bridge, which connected the informal settlements to the wealthiest part of the city in Buenos Aires. I remember at the beginning it was just a one-way long bridge and my supervisor said that I should consider various entries and exits to this long bridge for safety reasons. The idea of being watched and having no escape route is quite terrifying.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> It's a hard question to answer whether architects think of surveillance in the process or not, but I would say generally no. That's just my cynical side which thinks that majority of architects don't really think too critically and beyond their given "design" problems.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> I do think there are others (architects, urban planners, etc) who think about how to create spaces for "easy surveillance" which in turn have created some problematic spaces. For example the initial courtyard designs for Regent Park. I think architects and urban designers have often thought that having "eyes" on the neighbourhood will prevent bad things from happening, but I think it's more about enabling the community to hold each other accountable. So again I would say that providing space for community advocates to protect the community (especially the mothers and the women in communities)
This is more important than anything any architect or designer can build.

  <p class="interviewbody"> What if the dialogue about spatial surveillance was part of the design discourse or curriculum, like one of the common problems like natural light, proper ventilation that you had to solve? I’ve been meaning to dive into Jay Pitter’s pdf she provided for urbanists over the weekend, her teaching’s need to be integrated into architect’s curiculums for so many reasons. Perhaps without them we will keep getting Regent Park courtyards. Can you describe what the design situation was for the courtyard?
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> I think this idea of holding eachother accountable can be explored a bit. On one hand, we could have a panopticon effect, you know you are being watched, so you behave, but on the other hand, I think there needs to be thought on the ways you hold eachother accountable. There are all these surveillance snitch apps like NEXT DOOR where you can anonymusly report your neighbour. In a sense that is a form of accountability, but it takes away from the care and trust that I think is missing (and why we feel we need covid track and trace apps in the first place).

  <p class="interviewbody"> I'm also not an expert on Regent Park but from what I've read, the old design was all inward facing courtyards, which were parking lots, with no views out to the main street. So this created a little safe-zone for people who wanted to sell drugs and do other not-so-great things. The buildings themselves covered the crimes which were happening internally. I don't think they've done a great job with the "revitalization" either. They keep praising it but gentrification isn't really the answer. We don't need more Karens.... and people calling out people for no reason. I think deeply rooted existing community structures need to studied and scrutinized more.

  <p class="interviewbody"> I think sometimes we have this belief that architecture and design (in this case of the covid apps) or social media can actually solve deep rooted systemic issues. It sometimes feels like slapping a bandaid on a spewing drainpipe. These things are just the back drop to daily life, and although they can enable devastating consequences, they still are a product of deeply held beliefs and biases. I always think back to an example I read about a reserve in Canada (I don’t remember where exactly). The community consistantly had these 911 calls where the ambulance couldn’t get to the paitient in time, because the houses didn’t have house numbers. The ambulence drivers didn’t know or didn’t care enough to learn or couldn’t learn who lived where in these reserve communities. This one little thing like access to a house number that was denied for whatever reason time and time again fails the community.

  <p class="interviewbody"> Yeah I agree with these “gadgets” not really helping the deeply rooted issues. It’s like slapping windmills and solar panels on a house and calling it a day in terms of addressing the climate crisis.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> I think humans need these tangible things in order to make them feel good about doing something for a larger systemic change. I think both are needed in order to meaningfully change things.  However if the focus is only on one angle (whether it’s more macro or micro), it doesn’t work as effectively in my opinion.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> So the issues of surveillance can be and should be addressed with small incremental changes alongside larger and deeper conversations about why we even need it. How can we create a world where we don’t need to really have cameras? Why do people steal? How can we address that while at the same time thinking of short term fixes. It’s like the bodycam for cops, it doesn’t work, and hasnt stopped police brutality. At least in some cases we have evidence of what’s happening. Things won’t change unless we take what we learn from these small changes, and apply them to the larger conversation of why do the police represent? Why do they have so much power? How can we take away some of that power?
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> So I think it’s necessary to do all we can from all possible angles. There aren’t any linear solutions to creating a more just world. We gotta try every single zigzagy route possible.
