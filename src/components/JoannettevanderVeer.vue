<p class="interviewbody">With your knowledge and interest in AI, I'm wondering what do you think of the fact that a corona-virus track and trace application could become slowly and maybe eventually the norm?
 </p>

 <p class="interviewbody">For me, I feel conflicted! On one hand it could be useful to understand and slow the virus. On the other hand, there seems to be so much at stake. Privacy, interpersonal relationships, how we move through public space, these apps could work to further isolating poorer neighbourhoods or individuals; I could go on and on.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody">Secondly I'm wondering do you have a conscious relationship with surveillance in your life? For instance, do you notice when it pops up day-to-day, out in public space, in the grocery store, using your phone, etc? Or does it just seem to exist in the background....</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I believe the track and trace app being introduced into our lives is worrisome and harmful. I think it only prevents already privileged bodies from further harm since they have access to information presented to them in their languages(s) and access to these technological tools and digital aid kits. </p>

<p class="interviewbody">I think these track and trace applications are pretending to be helpful and provide a false sense of security whilst the users privacy is harmed under the guise of health reasons. It also may cause more harm than good in that people who have been exposed to the virus might be exposed to other harmful actions. For example being called out by someone who believes you are infected and being publically dragged, a rise in racism, and no sense of privacy indeed.</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I am aware of surveillance I would say in peaks… At first I wasn’t that aware, but when I did become aware I started to notice more and more how much it is present in my daily life. Of course I notice the camera in the drug store or in the supermarket, in the tram or elsewhere.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I would say it is a conscious relationship, but I should be active in trying to (start to) erase my digital skid marks, (haha). Because we come across and interact with a lot of shit online. Some shit that we did not even sign up for to begin with. Or shit we weren’t aware of.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">My boyfriend for example noticed that Amazon Prime charged him on a monthly basis for a service he never used, never asked for, never signed up for: NOTHING. I did some research and saw that there were many others who experienced this. Again, he and I have the tools to take action but what if you don’t? What if you don’t have daily access to the internet, your bank account- all of that.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">This pisses me off the most, that companies decide to let an algorithm/AI or whatever execute tasks for them and traces peoples bank account in order to do things and make money over the backs of others. It digitally and physically disgusts me. Phygital disgust – can we coin that term perhaps more often?
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I try to make others aware of it as well, to protect them from being harmed by systems created by companies run by human beings who don’t have any morals or ethics or the courage to speak up or take any responsibility in this.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">And then there’s another thing. Yesterday I joined the protest in Rotterdam and there was a freaking police drone that – other than causing a stir and a lot of confusion – did nothing to make the protestors feel more at ease or safe and secure. Exactly the opposite occurred.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">After my boyfriend and I returned home, I mentioned to him that the only moments I felt unsafe was when the police decided to use acts of surveillance (screaming through loudspeakers attached to cars or drones). Both the screaming through the loudspeaker and the drones “voice” were completely inaudible.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">In what way does a drone provide for a safe space for anyone attending the protest against police violence, racism, injustice and inequality? You know, the way the authorities decide to communicate to their audience(s) is in so many ways unequal. We do not all speak the same language. Perhaps we are less abled to hear you. How can someone secure themselves if they are not being informed well by governmental bodies who say they wish to “secure the area” or make sure everyone is safe”. You have to ask “who” is everyone in this line of thought in the first place.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Whoo that’s a lot to digest… Hope you can work your way through it, haha.

<p class="interviewbody">To your first point I’ve been thinking a lot about how things are designed (like if we were designing this app) in my experience the process usually ends or drastically decreases after the product or building you design gets released into the “wild”. In my experience the accountability of the designers, developers and government officials with tech in general is kind of this test and release mentality. And I’m wondering if we have to get this app – and you're right in that MANY people don't have smartphones or know how to operate them, and that heavily excludes A LOT of people.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">But I would say that this sort of mandatory government app for the privileged already exists, the Digid login service. The other day I was forced to only use the app instead of the computer to log in, and I thought, this is challenging for me, an able bodied, educated, English speaking, young person this would prevent many people from accessing their vital information regularly. So these kinds of “solutions” has already been around for a long time.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody"> And so I wonder if there is any accountability there in the design process of these apps. How will they know what to fix? Who is their focus group? Who are they really making this app for?
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Wow my friends told me about the drone as well – it had a female voice did it not? What sort of control does yelling at a crowd achieve? Does it contribute to more noise, filtering out clear communication between the protestors and causes more confusion? This technological tool was probably thought of, as a great ”idea”. By using a drone are they able to send less police officers to the protest? Like why use the drone?
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I read something a while back (cite the article) about this mentality that tech developers love to “test drive” their products first, no matter the consequences I hate to think that this centers around a design discourse, BECAUSE IT OBVIOUSLY IS ABOUT SO MUCH MORE than that but I think that these tools are all part of the system, part of the problem.

<p class="interviewbody">To respond to your last comment:
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I think what it comes down to is that if the designers are biased (which in most if not all cases they most certainly are) the systems, tools, apps they design are as well.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">What I find so unbelievably ridiculous is to think about digital surveillance and offline surveillance - whereas firstly most AI’s and algorithms did not manage to detect the faces of black people, or POC, security cameras and officers most certainly do recognize, detect, or signal these faces. And in a way, the ways in which AI’s aren’t able to bring sensitivity to the table and are often generalizing, we see this in a lot of people performing their powers over others as well. I find it hard to explain this harmful dynamic in an encompassing way, but I try to explain it as much as I can.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody"> In order to design wisely, inclusive, equal, and without generalizing or discriminating the question is where to start… it’s very hard to change a design process without changing the designer’s or design team's POV and making them aware of their privilege, biases, and other mechanisms within their daily lived lives and realities that keeps them from designing an app or tool that does not have issues of racism, sexism, discrimination, exclusivity or offensiveness included. I am really trying my best to find positive ways in which these tools could help… but yeah… it’s hard to be optimistic about both on- and offline systems that have failed so many people for so, so many years. Perhaps an encoded anti-racism mechanism bit / bot / system should be mandatory for all apps to be developed. But then this mechanism should also be one that is anti-age-discrimination, anti-less-abled-bodies-discrimination, anti-etcetera, etcetera. Where does a designer get their knowledge from? If they are ill informed or receive one-sided Intel, this will obviously affect the end result that could mean a bad start for so many other things to occur. There are so many things to take into account, yet it is necessary to think about and act upon this fact.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody"> Heading back to the drones - if there was some sort of responsiveness within it and a listening ear instead of a blasting voice, the drone itself or at least its reputation might become less infiltrating. If the drone were to ask instead of to dictate…. If it was there to help instead of to hinder… I don’t know. I used to be more tech-optimistic beforehand. But perhaps that was also when I was more optimistic about humanity altogether. Oooofff this sounds so sad!!!! And it is!

  <p class="interviewbody">Yes I agree with you fully there, and it directly correlates with what's going on in the world right now, if we don’t work to educate ourselves, overhaul the educational systems, do the work over and over and over, nothing will change here. I guess what I’m trying to do is talk to a number of people I know with very different backgrounds, perspectives and worldviews to try and broaden my view on surveillance, because it obviously goes way beyond my own perspective.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> Also YES TO PHYGITAL DISGUST. I feel it often, daily sometimes, and I wish I could turn off and tune out, but you can’t. I was interviewing an architect friend of mine Reza Nik, and he said it was helpful for him to view surveillance as like a scaffolding rather than a super structure, something that could be flexible and change and adapt, because in a way, I see how surveillance at these protests, with cell phones, civilian videos are on one hand operate in a way of protection or visibility.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> Many of these deaths and injustices have occurred on camera, and without the many, many, many different videos from different angles we start to piece together more of the story of these awful incidents. So is that also qualified as surveillance? Do you think surveillance comes only from the authorities, from the top down? Or is there another definition?
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> One of the things I’ve been thinking about is if we have multiple definitions maybe we could name the different beasts. Because the drone at the protest is different than the cell phone video, is different from Amazon sneakily stealing your boyfriend’s money and is different from a supermarket camera. Thinking more about the drone if its function is just a mobile loudspeaker, is its purpose is to drown out the collective voices of the protestors?

  <p class="interviewbody"> Interesting point you mention about the cell phone / camera videos. I do believe they can also be qualified as surveillance - yet both for the good and for the bad. For the good in terms of visibility, and for showing the actual voices stories and storylines that make up the overall narrative. We should all see and hear more of this, however cruel it is. But for the bad in the sense that people are also backlashed online when they are visible in these videos or photos circulating online. I am not speaking of the Amy Cooper’s of our society, but the ones that stand up for their rights and receive many a racist slur and threat after their faces become public.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> When the protest here in Rotterdam was forced to end, people started marching through the city peacefully. And then there were these special unit buses driving through red lights like crazy to follow the crowd. Nothing else was imposing a threat other than that police van. At one point I thought of following the crowd just that if something would happen I could perhaps be a witness and be able to document any event - but what kind of fucked up surveillance is that? It is passive protection in retrospect and that is only if justice is served afterwards… Also, I read this post by someone from Columbus, Ohio stating that people should turn off their location, WIFI, and all other tracking apps when protesting in order to prevent the cops from coming to their homes afterwards… It gives me the chills.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> I would like to refer to something that was said by a party member of NIDA Rotterdam in a talk show - he mentioned that in the video of George Floyd, everyone needs to ask themselves who they are in that video, what position they take… Is it the position of the policeman killing Floyd? The police officers that were present but did not act? The bystander who does or does not speak up? Perhaps you’re just passing by and continuing your route without paying much attention? I thought this was a simple yet powerful way to position oneself in the debate and towards the necessary actions to be taken.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> I do feel comfort in the idea that there’s more than top-down surveillance. That there is a sense of community surveillance as well, people looking after one another, people warning and protecting each other through these online mediums. This also happens offline. People looking after each other, after complete strangers, and trying to make sure everyone stays safe in the situation they all find themselves to be in. Perhaps we should call it something other than surveillance. I do not have the right words yet, but community lookouts or collaborative community care, something like that but then coherent haha. Instead of checking up, we should check in on each other more often...

  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody">As for the comment / idea about the drone I think it just drew away our attention to that what mattered. I don’t know if you watch Rupaul’s Drag Race but I’d like to also refer to this moment by Jaida Essence Hall in which she caused for confusion within a political debate by drawing the attention away from what was really important:
  </p>


  <p class="interviewbody">So perhaps, indirectly, it is to drown out the collective voice by disrupting what we all could hear and see at that particular time…
