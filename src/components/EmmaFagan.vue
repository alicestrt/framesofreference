<p class="interviewbody">Being fortunate enough to have extra time to think I've began to think about surveillance as a more multifaceted thing.

I used to think of surveillance being a black and white problem, all bad, nothing good and it is still has its problems, but with the coronavirus spreading around the world, some countries like Singapore, Israel and certain parts of Australia (here's a <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-pandemic-is-a-trojan-horse-for-surveillance-programs-around-the-world-887fa6f12ec9">link</a>) are implementing apps to track the population in regards to the virus. I wonder if this is a way forward? Currently there is no proof that these apps work as it is still way too early to know.

I'm curious to know what you think about this, I remember that you used to use an app to monitor your sleeping patterns. I think we've always had a different relationship to how we use technology, (which is a good thing everybody's different!) so maybe you can shed a little light on your personal experience.

<p class="interviewbody">Firstly I had all intention of reading the article you sent before responding but its tres long. I have read some app corona theory and plans so I do know some of what you’re talking about.</p>

<p class="interviewbody">The way I see it is that data tracking for the corona virus still implicitly relies on trust in the user to be honest, which if the Internet has taught us anything, it’s that you cannot trust the user to be honest. There is a dominant sub culture to use the Internet to mask our selves and be bolder, louder, prettier, more interesting and more perfect. Because to put up a less than perfect facade is to be on stage inviting the criticisms of others emboldened and protected by the distance of the Internet to judge you.</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I've seen so much on using phone and GPS data to track the spread but until our phones can test us without our consent (or even with it) so that they do in fact have the data to track I struggle to see how tracking the population really serves to help. How will these apps know who has coronavirus? To even suggest you've had contact with the disease, first users have to choose to be honest about being sick. I question how freely people would opt to be honest when it would also put them at risk of being ostracized. Big data isn't any use when we are missing the data it requires to function, no?</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I used to have an app to track my sleep, as you know I have never been a good sleeper. In the beginning it felt innocent. In the middle it offered humour when I rated my sleep every morning and a new partner caught me and thought I was rating his performance. Near the end it felt like big brother was listening, it was another tie that forced me to have my phone with me at all times even when I was asleep because I liked how it woke me up. That same partner showed me a more mechanical app for waking up with none of the tracking and listening so I switched.</p>

<p class="interviewbody">These things creep in; they are innocent or hopeful at first, then unsettling as we catch up on our digital literacy. In a time where everyone is in shock I worry about big data's efforts to rebrand themselves as essential components to our survival. I still use them but I am more skeptical. I don't trust big data to save us here. I like the narrative that big data corporations are weaving, it’s a lovely fairy tale but it lacks an obvious monster and no fairy tale exists without a villain.</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Yes, this idea of trust is huge. Sometimes I wonder is there any trust left? I would say yes, there is some; otherwise no one would obey the various lock-down rules and regulations within each country. But maybe that obedience is less based on trust and more based on fear. I don't know. Sometimes I fantasize a stronghold benevolent dictatorship; where everyone loves, trusts and obeys their leader, so they would naturally and willingly give all their personal information over.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Or if there was new cult app like Instagram but instead of hiding your location and how your physical health was at that moment, you would post hourly updates and see all your friends as well. Maybe making it cool to participate in mass state surveillance and very uncool not to participate would work, and I feel that maybe this is already happening.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">That's interesting that you mention or (maybe I am interpreting this) the idea that we don't like to track our weaknesses. Involving an app would expect us to be honest with how we were physically feeling. (Speaking from personal experience here) I think modern society conditions us to push through whatever we are feeling and in this way we aren't being honest with our bodies. It requires a shift maybe to honestly admit that your not feeling good today and I think that would be hard for a lot of people and exactly like you said, increase the fear of public ostracization.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">For me gaining knowledge is helpful but I also feel the limits of too much knowledge and too much tracking. Big data includes EVERYTHING, and finding useful information is like combing the ocean for a teeny tiny grain of sand.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Everything is already tracked on our phones anyways and there is already so much surveillance woven into our lives. I think that this tracker app, functional or not, is just one more step to normalize surveillance. I'm wondering do you think there should be multiple varied definitions of surveillance, making new form’s to give name’s to these new issues?</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Everything is totally already tracked! Remember that audible conversation with your friend that leads to the corresponding Instagram ads that day?  It’s so spooky. It's the norm now. We’ve accepted being spied on as the cost of buying in to access internet and social connection we've all come to rely on.</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I'm super interested in the idea of breaking the terminology down into different forms of surveillance. To label and address them in smaller forms rather than general 'big data' might help us digest them and understand what it is we are giving up or exposing rather than normalizing a growing lack of agency. I don't feel like I know how to rename them or even name them in the first place. There is the surveillance that pushes targeted consumerism. There is the surveillance that reveals the online personas of physical people you may have met. There is the surveillance that suggests you go for a run this morning at 7am.
</p>


<p class="interviewbody">I was thinking about trust in a capacity of our unwillingness to divulge weakness, but also I know that maybe that's very specific to my view. I get very sensitive around the idea of being weak and hate to show weakness to people I care about for fear of being written off as defective. I think this starts to tie back to our earlier mention of trust on the Internet and contemporary society. I think there is a huge amount of trust out there, although maybe interestingly, I think it's one sided. As a user I want to have faith in the good people on the Internet and therefore I try to be good and kind when on the Internet. I trust myself and I trust the void to take what I share and be good, gentle and kind. In the opposite direction I approach anything incoming with scepticism, even from people I know and trust. I often wonder how much of everything is an advertisement? Or what does someone's life truly look like, in contrast to what they share? We are privileged enough that we count trust as the key component to the Internet instead of fear. Or maybe this is where we differ, I chose to trust and let apps track my sleep but I think you express more fear towards it? When you chose to share something is the dominant emotion for you fear or trust?

  <p class="interviewbody"> Oh boy, fear. Definitely fear. When I share something it's kind of like jumping off a cliff isn't it? Although its implied that there is water to which I will land and I know how to swim. So there is a backbone, albeit a very thin one of trust behind the fear. Otherwise I wouldn't do anything, ever. There is also a big participation bias for me, everyone is doing it, and I don't want to be left in the dark.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> How to even start to categorize and separate the different types of surveillance? I wonder what the benefit of that action might be. Could you opt in to some types and opt out of others? The problem is the mysterious third parties. Who gets your data and how does it get used? We have little to no idea who those companies are and what their interests and objectives are. Damn transparency seems so out of reach. I always think of this scrambled eggs concept for combating surveillance. The idea is that you flood the source with your data, so much data that the receiver can't make heads or tails of it. But I don't believe that is really a sustainable method.</p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> Trust and Fear are opposing polls I don't think you can have one without the other, but it’s interesting to me that fear is your dominant and trust is mine. If people stopped jumping off the cliff there would be no more fun! I hate that participation bias is a driving force but I suppose it always has been. It drives me too; I just get caught up in the dopamine rush and forget, a true victim of the cause.</p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> I supposed the targeted benefit would be knowledge of what was happening behind the veil and with that knowledge maybe we could have a choice of what we do and don't want to participate in. When I moved from Canada to England I noticed a huge change in how cookies are restricted here vs. in North America. SO MANY CONSENT POP-UPS!! It brings to light how many spaces are taking data that you don't necessarily notice. In North America no one asks for permission they just do it. Initially I was just saying yes because I thought to say no would mean I wouldn't be able to access the content beyond, but then I started saying no and realized from my side it made no difference. Some websites have been a total pain to say no to though. One of my favourite websites for instance has a BRUTAL one. It takes up half a page! If you try to ignore it and say no, then individual boxes pop up to toggle off around 100 different third parties, some of which you can't toggle off without going to their separate websites. It was so frustrating I thought about just giving up visiting the website or writing to them saying, “do you know how gross your site is in the UK with AD bots???”  The site has operated that way for years I never saw it because without legal obligation to notify me, I kept clicking on through without  thinking twice.

  <p class="interviewbody"> RE: scrambled eggs. Did you see <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/teens-have-figured-out-how-to-mess-with-instagrams-tracking-algorithm/ ">this one</a>?? This teenage girl started a group Instagram account so that the algorithm showed her different content every day that wasn’t tailored to her specifically. It renewed my faith in the youth. I squealed with delight and tried to think of whom I could do this with so that Instagram could show me variety. But it is far from easy and not sustainable, a start of a revolt though? It makes me hopeful.</p>
