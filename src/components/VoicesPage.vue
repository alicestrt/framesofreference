There is a dominant sub culture to use the Internet to mask our selves and be bolder, louder, prettier, more interesting and more perfect. Because to put up a less than perfect facade is to be on stage inviting the criticisms of others emboldened and protected by the distance of the Internet to judge you. </p>
