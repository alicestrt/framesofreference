            <p>The way I see it is that data tracking for the corona virus still implicitly relies on trust in the user to be honest, which if the Internet has taught us anything, it’s that you cannot trust the user to be honest. There is a dominant sub culture to use the Internet to mask our selves and be bolder, louder, prettier, more interesting and more perfect. Because to put up a less than perfect facade is to be on stage inviting the criticisms of others emboldened and protected by the distance of the Internet to judge you. </p>
