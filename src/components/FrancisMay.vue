  <p class="interviewbody">Canada’s version of the covid-19 track and trace app for Ontario is due to be released on July 2nd. Could this app be something that you could see yourself downloading?

<p class="interviewbody">When I think of surveillance and how it impacts my daily life, I usually think about it in terms of consumption. Let me clarify that a little bit. I guess what I mean to say is that most of the platforms, or the software keeping tabs on my location, or my search engines, are tools that I actively choose to engage with. I can go into this a bit further as we go along... </p>

<p class="interviewbody">Regarding the covid-19 track and trace app, I don't plan on getting it once it's released. I'm not sure how effective the app is in really helping people know about the state of their health and I think that building up public health infrastructure in other ways (Ontario has been notorious for lagging numbers due to an outdated reporting system) is more important. There's a tendency to want to solve issues of chronic underfunding of public institutions with simplistic apps and other gizmos; making the whole effort behind the app seem superficial (at least that's how I see it). I also feel like having an app tell you that were in close proximity to someone with covid-19 would is extremely anxiety inducing. I can elaborate on this more if you want!</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Have you ever chosen to not consume something, because of it’s seemingly lack of privacy? And when you do choose to consume something or engage with a platform, what is your approach? I'm also curious about the covid-19 reporting system in a Canadian context.

<p class="interviewbody">I haven't made too many conscious decisions of not choosing to engage with a product due to the lack of privacy. Having used computers since I was a kid and playing different games, it felt like the issue of surveillance didn't really come up, as it wasn't enough of a deterrent to using Neopets (a poor example I know).
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">The appeal to using different platforms online often outweighs the things we might not think of or see as being negative/infringing on our privacy. If anything, at this point I'm more prone to let go of a social media account if I feel apathetic towards it or if I'm using it too much on a daily basis.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">When it comes to the reporting system, from what I know, Public Health Ontario was unable to aggregate data as quickly as the media (i.e. the total tally of cases they would present was less than all the cases from local public health units, (if they were added up one by one). On that note, the government has slashed funding for Public Health Ontario in recent years, so the work that's being done now to have a better data management system could have been done earlier.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I also wonder who is in charge of developing the app and how the data will be handled. I usually feel more offended if the government sells my data, versus if a private company sold my data. I guess this is because a private company is providing services I rely on, versus government services that I have the choice of buying into.

  <p class="interviewbody"> From what I've read the Ontario government is partnering with Digital Services Ontario, Blackberry and Shopify. Blackberry and Shopify has apparently done this on a volunteer basis. I wonder what's in it for them?
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody">If the government is true to its promise that the data will be deleted after the covid-19 is “over” then Shopify and Blackberry will have done the government a huge favour, which they could perhaps ask or demand for future collaborations. Why is public health data being handled by a company (Shopify), whose business is making websites to sell products online? Do Blackberry and Shopify have access to this data? Are they going to delete it after? There has been little to no mention of concern about this in the media, just that the companies are favourable volunteers.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> I don't think these apps will be voluntarily downloaded enough for the track and trace method to be effective. But I do think that the introduction of these apps sets the stage for what could be a mandatory download in the future.

  <p class="interviewbody">I think there also has to be a question of access to the app as well. Not everyone has access to a smartphone and with that in mind the data would be skewed. I think there’s enough of a crowd of “early adopters” who would download it when it comes out, but I doubt that it could gain enough traction to make a significant difference (I know that in France not that many people downloaded the app, for example).
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> I think you make a good point about what Blackberry and Shopify want out of this. What their incentive is to work on this “for free”? I think a lot of the time with Big Tech, services are being billed as being free (and to a certain extent, they are) but we forget that a lot of Big Tech doesn’t work with conventional revenue streams.

  <p class="interviewbody"> Ironically, our most at-risk groups for covid-19, the elderly, or low income folks will be the people who cant easily use the app or at all. Can you elaborate on what you mean by non- conventional revenue streams?

  <p class="interviewbody"> An example of that could be Google; the service is free to use, but the way in which search results are structured will depend on location (provided by the user) and the results at the very top are usually paid for. Similar to how Facebook is free to use but pools data from web searches to show relevant ads to the user. I think a lot of that is lost on the public (because it’s not as clear as going to a shop and buying something). I also think though that most people are increasingly aware of this, but again, we’re so conditioned to using these platforms (to the point that they’ve become tools) that I think most people have become apathetic about it.
