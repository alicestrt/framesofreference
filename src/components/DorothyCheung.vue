<p class="interviewbody">Ever since the pandemic began, I've started to talk to my family back in Canada more frequently. I've noticed some differences regarding the coronavirus measures and the conversation surrounding surveillance between Canada, and the Netherlands.</p>

<p class="interviewbody">For example in Canada the social distance they recommend is 2 meters and here in The Netherlands it is 1.5 meters. None of my friends or family has heard of a track and trace app, even though there are plans to implement it nationally soon. In contrast, I found in the Netherlands, the discourse surrounding the app was widespread and still debated frequently.</p>

<p class="interviewbody">So since you've experienced living in three different countries in the past year, (so many moves!) I was wondering if you notice any difference in how surveillance operates, say in the UK, compared to Hong Kong or the Netherlands, and are these operations part of the public conversation?</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I came back to Hong Kong in March when the outbreak of covid-19 caused the anti-government protests to pause for a while. Things had been quite quiet during that time. When I landed in Hong Kong I was asked if I prefer a GPS bracelet or to share my location on WhatsApp. I had heavy jetlag (and I queued almost an hour before that) so I just took the share location option, which has proved to be quite weird since then.</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Of course, I could have left my phone and ran away (but I didn't). I was supposed to be sharing my location solely with the health department. But one morning I got a video call, the health department had to see me at my home; of course, they had to see my face. In that moment I felt that my space was invaded, even though it had to more do with covid-19 (than the protests). </p>

<p class="interviewbody">Sometimes, I feel proud of the Hong Kongers effort in preventing covid-19 to spread (as compared to other places). Sometimes I get angry when I see someone wearing a GPS bracelet eating out. These safety measures help us in some ways, but then maybe, the fear and obedience ultimately has to do with politics.</p>

<p class="interviewbody">A note on the UK, as I was not living in London, I wasn't aware of the surveillance as much. And the fact that I could use cash most of the time for grocery and travel (as I received my subsidy in form of cash) helped me to feel safer than I had felt when I lived in the Netherlands, where we were all forced or encouraged to use our PIN card and NS travel card almost all the time.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">It's interesting that you mention the difference between cash and card here. Everything can be tracked and we are used to this intensity, here in the Netherlands.  I also recently noticed that mant ATM’s are dissapearing. At the central market in Rotterdam, there are only two ATM's in that area, to service the thousands of market customers using cash to buy their groceries. I think cards are preferred by the ‘powers that be’ as you can collect patterns of consumption and then market products or services, or enact policies based on those patterns. Just another one of the "invisible" ways we are tracked.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">So was the option to share your location on WhatsApp the same as the GPS bracelet? One is a bracelet and one is a phone? Creating the feeling that you have “options” (a choice between the two) makes it seem like you have a teeny tiny bit of agency or "freedom" in the matter.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">When you got the video call, did they want to inform you of new covid-19 policy changes? Or was it more a digital checkup on your symptoms? I can imagine how it must have felt like an invasion of space or privacy. An unexpected call from a complete stranger so that they can see your face is quite a personal interaction.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Can you explain more about why you feel angry with someone wearing a GPS bracelet going out to eat? Is that because the GPS bracelets are temporary for when one arrives into the country?
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I noticed the card and cash situation right away because the first months in The Netherlands were really difficult without cards (I guess you noticed that as well). Even getting a beer at WORM (a local bar in Rotterdam) requires a working PIN card. And of course, with the protests now in Hong Kong, people try to avoid using the transport card (especially those that are not anonymous). MTR (the transport operator in Hong Kong) is known to be working with the government. They can easily track down a person with the data provided by using the card. Taking the bus or minibus, on the other hand, is a much safer option, as you can simply get away with using coins or cash.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Somehow it is hard to get used to using coins again (ending up with a heavy wallet) when being back in Hong Kong after almost 3 years, but I still try. I am glad that there are still options here (unlike The Netherlands) I can imagine if the same thing (although very unlikely) happens in the Netherlands, it would be extremely difficult for one to survive or obtain access to essential services like food or transport without being traced.</p>


<p class="interviewbody">When I returned to Hong Kong in March the government required everyone coming in from Europe and the US to stay self-quarantine for 14 days. They also used system to trace these people. When there was an influx of everyone returning home, they still had two options; to use location sharing or the GPS bracelet. Later, the government reduced the options to the GPS bracelets for everyone. The system was a bit broken, as many people found they couldn't register, or the GPS just didn't work. You can stop sharing your location or take off the bracelet after 14 days.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">These tracking policies were implemented in a rush, as the no one expected people would return home, as the situation in Europe and the US got worse. In fact, somehow the GPS bracelet is a bit like the panopticon idea in which, you feel you are being watched so you behave.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I don't know who does the checking on WhatsApp or GPS or how frequently they check in. Even when I got video calls I couldn't see who was calling, they put a sticker over their phone camera, so I could only see a blank screen. There were times these check-ins caught me by surprise (especially when I slept in due to jetlag), but there were also times that they weren’t checking in at all (like the time when I forgot to turn on another 8 hours of location sharing).
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Meanwhile, when people with GPS bracelets who were supposed to be quarantining sneaked out, passers by were often terrified or even took a picture of them. It's quite interesting that other people became a part of, or even supported the surveillance system (and of course, I am not saying sneaking out is the right thing to do).

  <p class="interviewbody">So just so we are clear, regarding the MTR transport company working with the Hong Kong government; when you use your transport card, information of your current and past travel patterns are accessed by the government. They then can show up at your location, to arrest or detain you if you are suspected of actively protesting. Correct?
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody">You're the first person I've interviewed that has mentioned the panopticon. I can relate to this feeling. On one hand, I felt a sense of civic duty to behave, to stay inside, but on the other hand, I knew that everyone was watching me, whether I kept my distance, etc, and that completely modified my daily behaviour. Social media has set the stage to casually surveil eachother, enabling a vigilantism that I think can be quite dangerous.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody">The boundaries are so blurry here; our tools to communicate with our families and friends (WhatsApp) are also used for the government to literally call us to check that we are where we are supposed to be.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody">The Dutch government already has a vast network of where people are and what they are doing at all times. It really doesn't give you a lot of space to move, if any, really.</p>

  <p class="interviewbody">I wonder since you’ve finished your 14-day quarantine do you believe that your sharing location is now permanently turned off? Have Hong Kong officials made any statements about this?</p>

    <p class="metadata">On June 17, 2020 at 12:37 pm - Dorothy wrote:</p>

  <p class="interviewbody">Yes, that’s correct. Things have been changed quite a bit here in Hong Kong, even for myself being born and lived here for so long, I feel I am catching up to new things every day. Some have decided to boycott the MTR, hoping they would force a change in their behaviour, (sadly though, this is very unlikely).
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody">Because with what has happened here, the government has been using covid-19 as an excuse to forbid all sorts of protests (all the while it is legal to go shopping in shopping malls with tons of strangers) it makes you realize that the nature of these policies is never purely for our social health.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> Of course for ordinary people, it is impossible to know if the government can hack into your private conversations. I guess more of us are now switching to VPN as well, and be very careful on the information we share on the Internet.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> Somehow, the government here isn't that clever with their policies or, they just don't have to cover up their act as much as other democratic countries. While in the Netherlands, very often I feel I am living in a system that is marketed as a free, open and democratic one, which is also very dangerous as it might one day catch it’s citizens off guard.

  <p class="interviewbody"> That's interesting what you say in which different countries market themselves. I feel more surveilled, here in The Netherlands than I did when I lived in Canada. A small example: we had a garbage fine here because I left some paper recycling outside the bin that was already full, the paper had our address on it and we got a gigantic bill. I felt naive but also kind of shocked about the fact that going through someone’s garbage is normal practice here.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody">Do you think it's better to live in a country that's at the very minimum transparent about its surveillance policies?

  <p class="interviewbody"> Haha, ah yes the garbage bill, I got warned by my landlord when I first moved in it’s very common.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody">It is hard to say what is better. I guess most countries have access to personal information one way or the other, so it has more to do with which country is better monitored by it’s citizens. In the end, it is about how people can participate in politics at different levels, including digital/internet policies. I think Taiwan is doing quite well in that sense.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody">I think what is very sad for many communist or totalitarian states, is that people are used to not speaking up even they see something's wrong, and they are rewarded if they inform on someone. This kind of society is very difficult to live in. Again it circles back to the idea of panopticon.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> So, to answer the question, I would choose a society where people are free to talk about these subjects and policies.</p>

      <p class="metadata">On June 17th  at 1:39 pm – Gill wrote:</p>

  <p class="interviewbody">That's a great way of putting it. Can you explain what you mean by participating in politics at different levels? Do you mean online, offline, in different levels of government etc?</p>

  <p class="interviewbody">I think the informant society is increasing in The Netherlands, or at least the tools are in place to already implement this informant nature if the government has the desire to do so.</p>

  <p class="interviewbody">The City of Rotterdam has an online service where you select your neighbourhood and file complaints and tag it to the map so that an officer can come by and check out the situation. It can be anything from garbage on the street, to a loud domestic dispute. I wonder about the potential this has to alienate people who belong to that neighbourhood to engage in conversation about these issues themselves. Instead these small personal conversations are shuttled off to the government, it takes our power out of our hands really, maybe it's seen as being more convenient but it enables me to anonymously report someone and for many that can be really dangerous.</p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> In participating of policies at different levels I mean online, offline, in the community, and in the policy making process. I admire the Taiwan government and Audrey Tang (especially their reaction to covid-19). There is a very open <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52883838">platform</a> for its people to participate. As the article mentioned, it has a lot to do with trust. And it is a trust that is based on information and data, not marketing or belief. What I felt a bit strange sometimes in the Netherlands is how the people trust its government, I would be worried about how well my NS card knows me, but apparently many people take it for granted.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody">In the past (before I lived in The Netherlands) I thought The Netherlands is a very open country, especially their attitude towards LGBTQ people. But once I lived there I realised many laws are made to avoid conflict among people, and so, people are allowed to care less. Maybe for some people, that's the way to go, but for me, there is always a lack of something.

    <p class="interviewbody">" "Avoiding conflict among people means that people care less" This phrase brings to mind those physical demarcated spaces that many countries have made mandatory to protest in, keeping the protestors fenced in like animals so that conflict is avoided. Lack of care, or lack of visibility or confrontation means lack of action...
