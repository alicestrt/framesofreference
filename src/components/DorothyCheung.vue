<p class="interviewbody">Ever since the coronavirus, I've started to talk to my family back in Canada more frequently. I've noticed some differences regarding the coronavirus measures and the conversation surrounding surveillance between Canada, and the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="interviewbody">For example in Canada the social distance they recommend is 2 meters and here in The Netherlands it is 1.5 meters. None of my friends or family has heard of a track and trace app, even though there are plans to implement it nationally soon. In contrast I found in the Netherlands, the discourse surrounding the app was widespread and still debated frequently.</p>

<p class="interviewbody">So since you've experienced living in three different countries in the past year, (so many moves!) I was wondering if you notice any difference in how surveillance operates, say in the UK, compared to Hong Kong or the Netherlands, and are these operations part of the public conversation? </p>

<p class="interviewbody">I came back to Hong Kong in March when Covid 19 obviously caused the protests to pause for a while and things had been quite quiet during that time. When I landed in Hong Kong I was asked if I prefer a GPS bracelet or to share my location on Whatsapp. I had heavy jetlag (and I queued almost an hour before that) so I just took the share location option, which proved to be quite weird since then.</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Of course, I could have left my phone and ran away (but I didn't) and I was supposed to be sharing that location only with the health department. But one morning I got a video call from the health department, they had to see me at my home, of course, also my face. That moment I felt my space was invaded even though it has to more do with Covid 19 (than protests). </p>

<p class="interviewbody">Sometimes I feel proud of Hong Kongers effort in preventing Covid 19 to spread (as compared to other places), and then angry when I see someone wearing a GPS bracelet eating out. .. I guess the safety measures help us in some ways, but then maybe the fear ultimately has to do with politics.</p>

<p class="interviewbody">A note on the UK, as I was not in London I wasn't aware of the surveillance as much. And the fact that I could use cash most of the time for grocery and travel (as I received my subsidy in form of cash) helps me feel safer than in the Netherlands, where we were all forced/encouraged to use PIN and NS travel card almost all the time.

<p class="interviewbody">It's interesting you mention the difference between cash and card here; I notice that as well, everything can bewe are used to intense trackinged here in the NetherlandsNL and they are slowly but surely taking away ATM machines to prevent people from withdrawing cash. At the central market in Rotterdam there are only two ATMs I know of in that area, for thousands of market customers using cash to buy their groceries. I think cards are preffered by the (powers that be?) as you can collect patterns of consumption and then market products or services or enact policies based on those patterns. Just another one of the "invisible" ways we are tracked.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">So the choice to share your location on Whatsapp is just similar to the GPS bracelet, but one is a bracelet and one is a phone? Maybe creating the feeling that you have options (a choice between the two) makes it seem like you have a teeny tiny bit of agency or "freedom" in the matter.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">When you got the video call, did they want to inform you of new Covid policy changes? or was it like a digital home checkup on your symptoms? I can imagine how it must have felt like an invasion of space, I mean an unexpected call from a complete stranger seeing your face is quite a personal interaction.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Can you explain more about why you feel angry about someone with a GPS bracelet eating out? Is that because the GPS bracelets are temporary for when you just arrived back into the country?

<p class="interviewbody">I noticed the card and cash thing because the first months in The Netherlands was really difficult without cards (I guess you noticed that as well), even getting a beer at WORM (local bar) requires a working PIN card. And of course, with the protests now in Hong Kong, people try to avoid using the transport card (esp those that are not anonymous). One thing is the MTR (the company that owns the card system), is known to be working with the government. The other thing is they can easily track down a person with the data. Bus or minibus, on the other hand, is a much safer option, as you can simply get away with coins and cash.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Somehow it is hard to get used to coins again (and ending up with a heavy wallet) when being back in Hong Kong after almost 3 years, but I still try. I am glad that there are still options here (unlike The Netherlands)., I can imagine if the same thing (although very unlikely) happens in the Netherlands, it is really hard for one to survive or obtain access to essential services like food or transport without being traced.</p>


<p class="interviewbody">When I returned to Hong Kong in March the government required everyone coming in from Europe/US to stay self-quarantine for 14 days. They also put on a system to trace these people. During that period there was an influx of everyone going home, they still had two options; location sharing or GPS bracelet. Later, the government just used GPS bracelets for everyone, although the system was a bit broken, as many people found they couldn't register, or the GPS just didn't work. You can stop sharing your location or take off the bracelet after 14 days.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">These tracking policies were implemented in a rush somehow, as the no one expected people would return home, as the situation in Europe/US got worse. In fact, somehow it is also a bit like the panopticon idea - you feel you are being watched so you behave.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I don't know who does the checking on Whatsapp or GPS or how frequently they check in. Even when I got video calls I couldn't see who was calling, they put a sticker over their phone camera, so I could only see a blank screen. There were times these check-ins caught me by surprise (especially when I slept in due to jetlag), but there were also times that they weren’t checking in at all (like the time when I forgot to turn on another 8 hours of location sharing).
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Meanwhile, when people with GPS bracelets who were supposed to be quarentining sneaked out, passers by were often terrified or even took a picture of them. It's quite interesting in a way that other people became part of, or even supported the surveillance system (and of course, I am not saying sneaking out is the right thing to do.)

  <p class="interviewbody">So just so we are clear, regarding  the MTR transport company working with the Hong Kong government; when you use your transport card, information of your current and past travel patterns are accessed by the government. They then can show up at your location, to arrest or detain you if you are suspected of actively protesting. Correct?
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody">You're the first person I've interviewed that has mentioned the panopticon. I can relate to this feeling. On one hand, I felt a sense of civic duty to behave, to stay inside, but on the other hand, I knew that everyone was watching me, whether I kept my distance, etc, and that completely modified my daily behaviour. Social media has set the stage to casually surveil each other, enabling a vigilantism that I think can be quite dangerous.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody">Instagram has normalized this and made it fun! (sarcasm). The boundaries are so blurry here, our tools to communicate with our families and friends (whatsapp) are also used for the government to literally call us to check that we are where we are supposed to be.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody">I think we exist in such a dense web of surveillance systems integrated into every day life, the Dutch government already has a vast network of where people are and what they are doing at all times. It really doesn't give you alot of space to move, or any, really.</p>

  <p class="interviewbody">I wonder since you’ve finished your 14-day quarentine do you believe that your sharing location is now permanently turned off? Have Hong Kong officials made any statements about this?</p>

    <p class="metadata">On June 17, 2020 at 12:37 pm - Dorothy wrote:</p>

  <p class="interviewbody">Yes, that’s correct. Things have been changed quite a bit here in Hong Kong, even for myself being born and lived here for so long, I feel I am catching up to new things every day. Some have decided to boycott the MTR, hoping they would force a change in their behaviour, (sadly though, this is very unlikely).
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody">Because with what has happened here, the government has been using Covid-19 as an excuse to forbid all sorts of protests (while it is legal to go shopping in shopping malls with tons of strangers) it makes you realize that the nature of these policies is never purely for social health.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> The sharing location thing is on my Whatsapp. Of course for ordinary people, it is impossible to know if the government can hack into your private conversations. I guess more of us are now switching to VPN as well, and be very careful on the information we share on the Internet.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> Somehow, the government here isn't that clever with their policies (or, they just don't have to cover up their act as much as other democratic countries). While in the Netherlands, very often I feel I am living in a system that is marketed as a free, open and democratic one, which is also very dangerous as it might one day catch people off guard.

  <p class="interviewbody"> That's interesting what you say about how different countries market themselves, and completely true. I feel more surveilled here in The Netherlands then I did in Canada. A small example: we had a garbage fine here because I left some paper recycling outside the bin that was already full, the paper had our address on it and we got a gigantic bill. I felt naive but also kind of shocked, that going through someone’s garbage is normal practice here.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody">Do you think it's better to live in a country that's at minium transparent about its surveillance policies? Because then you are aware of what's going on to a certain extent.

  <p class="interviewbody">That’s a hard question to answer haha, maybe it's not the right question to ask, I don't know.

  <p class="interviewbody"> Haha, the garbage bill - I got warned by my landlord when I first moved in, apparently, it also happened to other people before.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody">It is hard to say what is better. I guess most countries have access to personal information one way or the other, so it has more to do with which country is better monitored by the people. In the end, it is about how people can participate in politics at different levels, including digital/internet policies. I think Taiwan is doing quite well in that sense.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody">I think what is very sad for many communist/totalitarian states, is that people are used to not speaking up even they see something's wrong, and they are rewarded if they inform on someone. This kind of society is very difficult to live in. Again it circles back to the idea of panopticon.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> So, to answer the question, I would choose a society where people are free to talk about these subjects and policies.</p>

  <p class="interviewbody">That's a great way of putting it. Can you explain what you mean by participating in politics at different levels? Do you mean online, offline, different levels of government etc?</p>

  <p class="interviewbody">I think the informant society is increasing in The Netherlands, or at least the tools are in place to already implement this informant nature if the government has the desire to do so.</p>

  <p class="interviewbody">Gemeente Rotterdam has an online service where you select your neighbourhood and file complaints and tag it to the map so that an officer can come by and check out the situation. It can be anything from garbage on the street, to a loud domestic dispute. I wonder about the potential this has to alienate people who belong to that neighbourhood to engage in conversation about these issues themselves. Instead these conversations are shuttled off to the government, it takes our power out of our hands really, maybe it's seen as being more convenient but it allow enables me to anonymously report someone and for many that can be really dangerous.</p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> I mean online, offline, in community, and policies making process. I admire Taiwan gov and Audrey Tang (esp their reaction to the Covid 19) due to this as well, there is a very open platform for its people to participate (one <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52883838">example</a>) As the article mentioned, it has a lot to do with trust. And it is a trust that is based on information and data, not marketing or belief. What I felt a bit strange sometimes in the Netherlands is how the people trust its government, I would be worried about how well NS card knows me, but apparently many people take it for granted.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody">In the past (before I lived in The Netherlands ) I thought The Netherlands  is a very open country, esp their attitude towards LGBTQ people. But once I lived there I realised many laws are made to avoid conflict among people, and so people can care less. Maybe for some people, that's the way to go, but for me, there is always a lack of something.

It brings to mind those physical demarcated spaces that many countries have made mandatory to protest in, keeping the protestors fenced in like animals so that conflict is avoided. Lack of care, or lack of visibility or confrontation means lack of action...
