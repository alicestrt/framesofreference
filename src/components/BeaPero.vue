<p class="interviewbody">I want to talk about your own <a href="/ https://www.llaqtadesign.com/mathematics-of-resistance"> work </a> first because I think it relates to our situation today. Could you give a short introduction to what your graduation thesis was about and why you felt that CCTV cameras should play a role in the mapping research that you completed?
 </p>



  <p class="metadata">On July 4, 2020 at 1:44 pm Bea wrote: </p>

<p class="interviewbody">In short, my thesis is a complex narrative of emancipation and political justice in Lima, Peru. It explores the sidewalk as a space of resistance, through the perspective of its non-dominant subjects, here referred to as Maria, whose sidewalk isn't a neutral space. In it, I used a multidisciplinary study and the means of mathematics to give shape to their intangible experiences. The outcome was a new set of spatial measurements that increase understanding and agency, and a network of polychromatic vendors that aim to improve the space through inclusive social control.</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Regarding CCTV:</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I conducted ethnographic research for my thesis and mapped the physical and non-tangible obstacles Maria experiences while on the street. An important one of which was CCTV and the "safe zones" they create on the street, as part of the means of exercising legal control over the subject. What the actual purpose of CCTV is if it doesn't make people feel safe, and when there isn't much public support. Mistrust in CCTV is widespread in Miraflores (Lima), as is exemplified by:</p>

<p class="interviewbody">•	 INEI’s report that 89% of the district’s population feel insecure within the district, despite an ever-increasing number of cameras and the ¨safe zones they create"
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">•	CCTV’s purpose in preventing crime is questioned, as there is minimal evidence of their role to prevent crime or being effective in court as the main evidence.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">•	The disheartening answer that came up was the role CCTV plays is that of controlling the access and movement of non-dominant members and enforcing racial and economic homogeny in affluent districts. Exacerbated by the control rooms being sites of discrimination, where officers define who belongs when and where, targeting all other types of people as needing to be controlled and disciplined. Also, in many cases the police doesn't even have control over the CCTV cameras, rather, municipal officers do, who are called Serenazgo; security guards enforcing municipal rules. The so defined "safe zones" proved that they mainly succeed in making the rest of the street unsafe, which is counterproductive.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">•	So CCTV cameras tend to be used not to prevent or discourage crime at all, but to exert control and exclusion over minorities, preserve normality and remove beggars and informal workers (who make up the majority of the Peruvian economy, which brings us into the disaster and chaos created by covid-19). Many times violently.

<p class="interviewbody">So if I understand this correctly, you went into the ethnographic research believing that the CCTV created “safe zones” and you began to map them as such. Did your mapping change after that revelation? For example did the cameras come to represent another negative barrier on the street rather than a beacon?
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Besides the facts and references that you provide, how did you come to the conclusion that people didn’t feel safe with the cameras there? Through your research, did you speak to anyone about their views on cameras in Miraflores?
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Miraflores?
So CCTV are more controlled by the corporations or municipalities, whose properties they reside on, rather than the government, or the police. Could it be stated that a CCTV is there to make sure that the dominant subjects remain on the street while the non-dominant, minorities are removed?

</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Its funny the language that we are sold in order to “accept” things like more CCTV on the streets.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">I was listening to a podcast called <a href="/https://citationsneeded.libsyn.com/episode-97-porch-pirate-panic-and-the-paranoid-racism-of-snitch-apps"> Citations Needed </a> where they drew a link between the rise of “true crime” shows like CSI, etc etc that portray suburban break-ins to white affluent home owners by non white robbers etc in America and the rise in CCTV cameras, neighbourhood cameras/ watch apps and increasing paranoia about crime. When actually, statistically crime has fallen in the US steadily.
</p>



<p class="interviewbody">I know it’s unreasonable to compare slightly because it’s a different situation but do you find there is an emphasis on this kind of vigilant protection or paranoia of crime in Lima that fear could justify more CCTV?
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Not exactly, before the research, I didn't think the safe zones worked, because I didn't think they had much of an impact. After the research, I realized how counterproductive they actually are, and how discriminatory the whole system is. Which also speaks to my own privilege into having to do research to realize it.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Throughout all the women I interviewed I asked them what their thoughts were on CCTV and if they made them feel safer or if they thought that CCTV is useful. Most answers ranged from “they are pointless” to “I don't like to walk under them because they are discriminatory”. However, some richer, older women I interviewed actually liked the CCTV because they believed that the cameras kept order and an eye on the street. And when I pressed into what they meant, they said that undesirable people were regulated. And when asked what define undesirable they said thieves, vandals, drunks and people from other districts that come to take advantage of the district. They classified non-white and poorer people together with criminals who had to be controlled.
</p>


<p class="interviewbody">Private organizations, municipalities, and police manage most CCTV’s. It just depends on where the camera is placed. For example, the municipalities manage sidewalk cameras, but the police manage the street light cameras, and private organizations and individual property owners place cameras on the facades of buildings.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody"> I would say the purpose of CCTV is to remove when possible, and otherwise to control and restrict for all who are non-dominant. We don't ask who benefits from the cameras even if we know it isn't us.
</p>

<p class="interviewbody">Of course, but I think you have the cause and effect wrong. The government, institutions and people in power, tend to have different levels of prejudice or "fear" for otherness (which keeps rising more and more in the current political climate). Installing CCTV, increasing police control or passing discriminatory laws is things that they will do, in order to feel like they are in control. However they stoke the fear and intolerance in the general public in order to justify increased policing, passing more legal barriers, etc. I am not sure if I am clear, but basically CCTV creates the need for public fear, which then creates more demand for CCTV.

  <p class="interviewbody"> Wow there is such a feedback loop happening here, thank you you made that really clear.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> Now if we can shift to a different kind of surveillance towards the track and trace apps that are being developed around the world. My understanding is that in many countries where the app is not mandatory, very few people are downloading. You need at least a 60% usage rate in order for it to “be effective”. Why do you think so few people want to use this app?
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> Sometimes I think we are slapping a technological solution onto what is a very human problem. Do you think that a more human solution could serve as an alternative to these track and trace apps? Like a public health check in person who isn’t your regular GP?

  <p class="interviewbody"> I suppose freedom is more important than mandatory surveillance and control and the payoff isn't worth it. Now, if this track and trace app would be disguised as a game where people didn't know what it was for, everyone would do it.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> I think we tend to always find a technological solution for every social problem. We take the superficial problems and say, “oh if people are just walking into the train without paying, we will put a barrier”. But that does nothing to solve real problem behind why people can’t pay for their public transport. It is the easy way out that doesn't address the larger issues. Design falls short of this, as it should when it’s thought of as a solution by itself.
  </p>

  <p class="interviewbody"> For corona, I don't even know what a solution could be. But I think surveillance shouldn't be the number one solution. Speaking only from the perspective of what is happening in the bigger cities in Peru, you can track whomever you want, make it mandatory to see a doctor and place specialists to do so and on top of that, make a mandatory fine that people are penalized for breaking quarantine. But if the economy is still informal, people still need to go out and work and interact with others. It is a choice between starving and maybe getting sick. What difference would tracking them make, except the difference of even more discrimination, control and fines?
